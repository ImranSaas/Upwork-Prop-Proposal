      description: `We're developing a 2D mobile game inspired by Mario Party, targeting a global audience. The game will include:\n\n- A main map with multiple themed worlds\n- Turn-based movement through each world (like Mario Party, but without stars)\n- Players advance by rolling, moving through steps, and playing short mini-games to earn points\n- Mini-games are simple, fun, and take less than 3 minutes to play\n\nWe're looking for a Unity developer to build the entire app, not just the mini-games. This includes the core game loop, world navigation, player progression, and integration of multiple mini-games. Ideally, you'll use existing Unity assets or plugins to reduce cost and speed up development.\n\nExample mini-games: Puzzle, Memory Flip, Rope Pull\nWe're cost-conscious â€” please suggest ready-made or simple mini-game templates where possible.\n\nIf you're interested, send your portfolio`,
