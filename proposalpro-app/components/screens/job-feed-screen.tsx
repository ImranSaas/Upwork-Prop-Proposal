      description: `We're developing a 2D mobile game inspired by Mario Party, targeting a global audience. The game will include:\n\n- A main map with multiple themed worlds\n- Turn-based movement through each world (like Mario Party, but without stars)\n- Players advance by rolling, moving through steps, and playing short mini-games to earn points\n- Mini-games are simple, fun, and take less than 3 minutes to play\n\nWe're looking for a Unity developer to build the entire app, not just the mini-games. This includes the core game loop, world navigation, player progression, and integration of multiple mini-games. Ideally, you'll use existing Unity assets or plugins to reduce cost and speed up development.\n\nExample mini-games: Puzzle, Memory Flip, Rope Pull\nWe're cost-conscious â€” please suggest ready-made or simple mini-game templates where possible.\n\nIf you're interested, send your portfolio`,

It would be more as a way of engaging guests and helping people to really understand and remember the key selling points of the vehicles.\n\nOur working idea for the game is that it'd be based around navigating city streets, aiming to make as many deliveries as possible in a fixed time e.g. 2 minutes.\n\nIt would need to be fully animated and offline enabled for tablet use.\n\nCurrently we are are looking for a ballpark cost to guide the client and set expectations.`,
